# TUBER-repo
EKASO team 

app name : Tuber 'temporary' 
The main idea of the app is to facilitate transportation in  a crowded envirement where finding a Taxi is hell of a task and an opportunity to have a job as a driver if u will.
As a user :
* The home page will give you the choice either to login as a user a customer who is looking for a lift or you can sign in as a driver
give you personal inforamtion including Driver licence Id car type and pictures .
the pictures will be verified by the admins of the page and after they decide to verify the driver acount or not. 
*As a Driver when i sign in i want to see a friendly interface where i can see my history of pickup and an option for my availability and how customer rated me.
*As a user I want an easy and wuick process to contact the nearest driver and i want to see the whole information of the lift meaning the price the driver info the car info and the estimated time to get to my destination.
*As a user I want to rate the driver (if not filler it s automaticly one star for the driver)
*If the drive has to many negative ratings he gets banned automatically.
